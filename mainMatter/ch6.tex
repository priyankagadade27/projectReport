\chapter{Conclusion}
In this thesis, methods that we applied balances the requirements of both appearance
enhancement and being faithful to the original appearance of an image has been
proposed and applied to the enhancement of full color images. Results have shown
the effectiveness of our algorithm in improving the contrast and colorfulness of
the original images. In this thesis, It is shown that we can get better image
from different Retinex Algorithms,Power Law Transformation, Histogram Equalization and Adaptive Histogram Equalization specification on color images gives us better results.

The Retinex Image Enhancement Algorithm is an automatic image enhancement method that enhances a digital image in terms of dynamic range compression, colour independence from the spectral distribution of the scene illuminate, and colour/ lightness rendition. The digital image enhanced by the Retinex Image Enhancement Algorithm is much closer to the scene perceived by the human visual system, under all kinds and levels of lighting variations, than the digital image enhanced by any ~\cite{lime} other method \cite{retinex}.
