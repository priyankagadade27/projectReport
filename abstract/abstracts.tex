\normalsize Image Enhancement is one of the important requirements in Digital Image
Processing which is very important in making an image useful for various applications which can be seen in the areas of Video Surveillance, Digital photography, Medicine, Geographic Information System, Industrial Inspection , Law Enforcement and many more Digital Image Applications. Image Enhancement is used to improve the quality of poor images. The focus of this dissertation is an attempt to improve the quality of digital images using various Retinex Model like Single Scale Retinex Model, Multi-Scale Retinex Model,Multi-Scale Retinex Model with color Restoration. Also this dissertation focused on Power Law Transformation, Histogram Equalization and Adaptive Histogram Equalization. In this dissertation i have applied various Retinex Model, Power Law Transformation,Histogram Equalization and Adaptive Histogram Equalization on color images with different color space.\\\\
